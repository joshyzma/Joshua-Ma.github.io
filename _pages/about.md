Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joshua, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Engineering with a specialization in Financial Engineering at Cornell University. Driven by a passion for applying quantitative techniques to transform financial markets, I am vigorously seeking internship opportunities in the finance sector for the summer of 2024. This pursuit is fueled by my desire to bring innovative solutions to the forefront of financial analysis and decision-making.


Experience

======
Research Consultant at WorldQuant (January 2024 - Present) 
---

At WorldQuant, my role as a Research Consultant involves tapping into a wide array of data sources to develop predictive models for equities. This work not only improves investment strategies but also refines the decision-making process for portfolio construction. My analysis of cutting-edge academic research has led to the creation of over 40 innovative, market-neutral Alphas. These have significantly improved the accuracy of predicting financial instrument price movements, enhancing the firmâ€™s quantitative trading strategies.

Quantitative Analyst Intern at Kuangte Technologies (June - August 2023)
---

During my summer internship at Kuangte Technologies, I developed and implemented trading strategies for the SSE 50 index options using Python API. By orchestrating rigorous backtesting on historical data, my strategies outperformed the index by 22% and increased our book's profit and loss by 4% annually. I also led a team in conducting extensive literature reviews to refine our existing strategies, which involved presenting our findings to senior management to inform strategic decisions.
